# UCLA-Miniscope

Open-source microscope for mice. Capable of recording neural activity through fluorescence techniques. 

Designed by Daniel Aharoni (dbaharoni@gmail.com)

This open-source miniature fluorescence microscope uses wide-field fluorescence imaging to record neural activity in awake, freely behaving mice. The Miniscope has a mass of 3 grams and uses a single, flexible coaxial cable (0.3mm to 1.5mm diameter) to carry power, control signals, and imaging data to open source Data Acquisition (DAQ) hardware and software.
